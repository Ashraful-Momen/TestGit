================================= sovle ========================================

The error you are seeing, non-fast-forward, indicates that the remote branch momen-dev has changes that you don't have locally. To resolve this, you need to pull the changes from the remote branch before you can push your changes. Here’s what you can do:
1. Pull Changes from the Remote Branch

bash

git pull origin momen-dev

This command will merge the changes from the remote branch momen-dev into your local momen-dev.

-------------> optional task!

2. Handle Merge Conflicts (If Any)

If there are conflicts during the merge, Git will pause and prompt you to resolve them. Open the conflicting files, make the necessary adjustments, and then mark them as resolved:

bash

git add <file_name>

After resolving conflicts:

bash

git commit

3. Push Your Changes

After successfully pulling and resolving any conflicts, you can push your changes:

bash

git push --set-upstream origin momen-dev

Alternative: Force Push (Use with Caution)

If you are sure that you want to overwrite the remote branch with your local changes (this will discard remote changes), you can use a force push:

bash

git push --force origin momen-dev

Note: Be careful with force push as it will overwrite the remote branch, potentially deleting others' changes.
