**Great thinking! Here's how to safely use your GitHub credentials on another PC for CI/CD and then remove them:**

**Option 1: Using Personal Access Token (Recommended for Temporary Use)**

**Setup:**
1. Go to GitHub → **Settings** → **Developer settings** → **Personal access tokens** → **Tokens (classic)**
2. Click **Generate new token**
3. Give it a name, set expiration (e.g., 7 days for temporary use), and select scopes:
   - `repo` (full control of private repositories)
   - `workflow` (for CI/CD)
4. Click **Generate token** and copy it (you'll only see it once)

**Use on other PC:**
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repo.git
# When prompted for password, use your token instead
```

**Remove after use:**
```
# Clear stored credentials
git credential-cache exit  # On Mac/Linux
# Or manually delete from credential manager on Windows
```

**Option 2: Using SSH Keys (More Secure)**

**Step 1: Create Custom SSH Key on Other PC**

```bash
# Generate SSH key with custom name and passphrase
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "temp-cicd@pc" -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_temp -N "your-passphrase"
```

Breakdown:
- `-t ed25519` = Key type (modern & secure)
- `-C "temp-cicd@pc"` = Comment/label for the key
- `-f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_temp` = Custom filename (you can name it anything)
- `-N "your-passphrase"` = Passphrase for the key (optional but recommended)

**Alternative: Interactive way (if you're not comfortable with flags)**
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "temp-cicd@pc"
# Then follow prompts:
# Enter file: /Users/username/.ssh/id_ed25519_temp
# Enter passphrase: (your password)
# Confirm passphrase: (repeat password)
```

**Step 2: View Your Public Key**
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_temp.pub
# Copy the entire output
```

**Step 3: Add Public Key to GitHub**
1. Go to GitHub → **Settings** → **SSH and GPG keys** → **New SSH key**
2. Paste your public key (the one ending in `.pub`)
3. Give it a title like "Temp CI/CD PC"
4. Click **Add SSH key**

**Step 4: Configure SSH to Use Custom Key**

Create/edit `~/.ssh/config` file:
```
Host github.com
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_temp
```

**Step 5: Test Connection**
```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
# Should output: "Hi yourusername! You've successfully authenticated..."
```

**Use on other PC:**
```bash
git clone git@github.com:yourusername/repo.git
```

**Remove after use:**
```bash
# Delete the SSH key files
rm ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_temp
rm ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_temp.pub

# Remove SSH config entry (edit ~/.ssh/config)

# Remove from GitHub: Settings → SSH and GPG keys → Delete the key
```

**Option 3: Using GitHub CLI (Cleanest)**

**Setup:**
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI
# Windows: choco install gh
# Mac: brew install gh

# Authenticate
gh auth login
# Choose HTTPS, paste your token when asked
```

**Remove after use:**
```bash
gh auth logout
# Clears all credentials immediately
```

---

**Best Security Practices:**
- Use **short expiration times** for temporary tokens
- Use **SSH keys over tokens** for better security
- **Add passphrases** to SSH keys for extra protection
- **Delete credentials immediately** after CI/CD is done
- Don't commit credentials or tokens to git
- Use `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive files

**Quick Cheat Sheet for SSH Key Management:**
```bash
# List all SSH keys
ls -la ~/.ssh/

# Check if SSH key works
ssh -T -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_temp git@github.com

# Remove a key
rm ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_temp*

# Test before deleting
ssh -T -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_temp git@github.com
```
